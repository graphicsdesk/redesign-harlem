Now, several involved parties are disputing the thread’s validity, the course’s relationship to the Harlem community, and the implications of the term “smart cities.” A press representative for the 125th Street Business Improvement District, the geographic area the students in the class plan to work with, denied the tweets’ principal claim: the course’s connection to the Office of the Mayor. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>The tweet and central controversy</b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Bronx resident @AchmatX on Sept. 16 tweeted that students in “Co-Designing Smart Cities,” which SIPA is offering for the first time this academic year, will partner with the Office of the Mayor, New York City Police Department, district attorney, and other agencies to “finalize their redesign of Harlem in which [Mayor Eric Adams’] office will use to draft policies.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The thread, which has over 10,500 likes and 5,000 retweets, also claimed the students within the class were all non-Harlem residents and mostly non-Black international students, and that neither the professor nor students have backgrounds in social work. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “It’s a bunch of rich kids walking around Harlem drafting policy to create a neighborhood that @Columbia students will feel safe and welcomed in,” @AchmatX wrote. @AchmatX did not return repeated requests for comment at the time of publication. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In her email, sent nearly a week after the thread was first posted, Yarhi-Milo addressed the public controversy and said the class, one of SIPA’s “community-focused” urban policy courses, was “not intended to ‘redesign Harlem.’” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Instead, she wrote that students will work with the 125th BID—a five-block radius in Central and East Harlem—to research challenges identified by the community and make recommendations to stakeholders “as part of the educational process.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The Mayor approved the establishment of the 125th BID, but its operations are overseen by the 125th Street District Management Association, a board of directors, and President Barbara Askins. The district stretches between the intersections of 125th Street and Morningside and Fifth avenues, which does not include Morningside Heights or Manhattanville. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “[@AchmatX] is railing against Columbia’s relationship with the Harlem community, and is using misinformation to attack the University by scaring people in the community into believing that students from Columbia are writing policy, and re-designing Harlem,” Sam Mattingly, the press representative for the 125th Street BID, wrote in a statement to Spectator. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Nothing could be further from the truth, including any involvement by the Mayor’s office, which there is none.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The Office of the Mayor did not return requests for comment at the time of publication. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>The class and its relationship to Harlem</b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> A copy of the syllabus obtained by Spectator describes the class as a “practical course” in which teams of students “co-design” proposed solutions for the 125th Street BID using “smart city innovations where relevant.” Taught by part-time lecturer Erika Whillas, the course consists of “lectures, guest speakers, workshops, and team presentations” aimed at teaching students how to tackle “urban governance problems from the user perspective.” Whillas did not return repeated requests for comment at the time of publication. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The 125th Street BID issues the course plans to address include “trash and rats, traffic and public safety, how to connect special needs populations to support services and programs, and improved coordination of NYC agencies and support services,” Yarhi-Milo wrote in her email. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “At the BID the focus is the 125th Street BID boundaries and addressing important issues plaguing those boundaries as a result of the pandemic, by finding solutions that lead to improved outcomes,” Mattingly wrote. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Neither the course syllabus nor Yarhi-Milo’s email mention any formal partnerships with the mayor’s office, NYPD, or district attorney, but guest speakers listed on the syllabus include representatives from the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office discussing the Pathways to Public Safety Division and previous Chief Technology Officer for the City of New York Miguel Gamiño Jr. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “We’re always proud to share student work with community stakeholders and appropriate city agencies,” Yarhi-Milo wrote. “The goal is always to improve the delivery of city services or make positive contributions that benefit residents.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> @AchmatX’s critique of the course and University for “attempting to gentrify Harlem” comes after a long history of Columbia’s expansion into West Harlem, most recently University President Lee Bollinger’s nearly two-decade <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/01/31/business-school-officially-moves-to-manhattanville-campus/">construction</a> of the Manhattanville campus. The $6.3 billion and 17-acre project has faced backlash from the community for using eminent domain to displace residents and <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/the-eye/2018/02/13/nine-years-later-just-1-percent-of-columbias-10-million-commitment-to-affordable-housing-has-been-spent/">failing</a> to deliver on a $10 million commitment to affordable housing in the area. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> A recent protest <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/09/23/students-and-harlem-residents-protest-gentrification-on-low-steps/">gathered</a> students and Harlem residents on Low Steps on Thursday evening to protest the University’s gentrification of Harlem and the privatization of public housing. Organized by the United Front Against Displacement, Columbia Housing Equity Project, and Columbia Student Worker Solidarity, the rally demanded the University “immediately cancel” the “Co-Designing Smart Cities” course. </p> <div class="image-partial"> <img src="SPC_7800.165a3f09.jpg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> Dozens of protestors organized on Low Steps Thursday demanding SIPA to cancel the course. </p> <p class="image-credit-text"> <span class="image-credit"> Photo by Kathy Fang </span> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “It seems to me that that class is basically using the guise of education to further Columbia’s own goals in the neighborhood,” Lula O’Donnell, BC ’23, a representative of SWS, said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Speakers at the event and several protestors interviewed by Spectator condemned the existence of the course and its potential impacts on Harlem. Donnell said the class encourages students to work with the city to “sanitize the neighborhood.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>[Read more: </i><a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/09/23/students-and-harlem-residents-protest-gentrification-on-low-steps/"><i>Students and Harlem residents protest gentrification on Low Steps</i></a><i>]</i> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In a statement to Spectator, the UFAD wrote that the organization is “deeply disturbed” to hear about the course and that it was “the latest in a long series of Columbia’s unrelenting assaults on the communities of Harlem.” The UFAD stated the class has “no real plans” to engage with Harlem and NYCHA residents, pointing to the University’s historic relationship with the community. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “In a typically arrogant fashion, Columbia imagines that they have a free hand to remake Harlem and the city in their own image,” the organization wrote. “It seems that Columbia University will not be content until it has entirely devoured Harlem, destroyed its rich history and culture, and regurgitated a hollow corporate wasteland in which the elite can comfortably distract themselves with various forms of luxury consumption.” </p> <div class="image-partial"> <img src="SPC_7541.37e418af.jpg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> The United Front Against Displacement, Columbia Housing Equity Project, and Columbia Student Worker Solidarity organized the protest. </p> <p class="image-credit-text"> <span class="image-credit"> Photo by Kathy Fang </span> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> A University spokesperson wrote in a statement to Spectator that Columbia SIPA has supported and worked with local Harlem community organizations for decades as “partners and collaborators.” The spokesperson also stressed SIPA’s belief that “being adaptive and responsive to community needs is an important part of public policy.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “We think this direct engagement is mutually beneficial to both our students and the Harlem community,” the spokesperson wrote. “We are listening to a broad group of community stakeholders along with faculty and students to explore the ways we can make positive contributions in our community.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>The implications of “smart cities”</b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In a flier distributed at Thursday’s protest, the UFAD claimed the class will use “controversial cutting edge AI surveillance technologies to expand the already sprawling repressive apparatus” of policing. The course overview of the syllabus does not explicitly mention surveillance, but it says community challenges such as “increases in crime management” could be assisted by technology and smart cities. The syllabus also notes these techniques can “intensify the digital divide,” “abuses of privacy,” and “public mistrust of the government and private sector.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Without public trust and confidence in smart cities they will not succeed,” the syllabus said. “We need to ensure that we design smart cities with a community-centered focus, to ensure they are places people want to live.” </p> <div class="image-partial"> <img src="SPC_7653.9581006b.jpg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> Protestors hold a sign from UFAD which says “tenants against gentrification” and “no to the privatization of NYCHA” in Spanish. </p> <p class="image-credit-text"> <span class="image-credit"> Photo by Kathy Fang </span> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The UFAD cited two articles in its statement to Spectator from <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/unchecked-smart-cities-are-surveillance-cities-what-we-need-are-smart-enough">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/cities/articles/2020-01-31/are-chinas-smart-cities-really-surveillance-cities">U.S. News</a> critiquing the emergence of “smart cities” as ways to surveil populations and violate “basic human rights.” The organization wrote it believed many Americans were not aware of how institutions like Columbia <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/04/30/with-a-decades-long-history-of-nypd-surveillance-local-muslim-communities-confront-a-legacy-of-police-informants-and-covert-intelligence/">employ</a> and lead the advancement of various surveillance methodologies. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “In a disturbing and dystopian euphemism, the course description notes that smart cities assist in ‘increases in crime management.’ Behind the veneer of this sleek wordplay is the reality that such policies massively expand surveillance, police brutality, and mass incarceration,” the UFAD wrote in its statement. “It is well known that so-called ‘smart cities’ are initiatives to expand surveillance and policing to unprecedented degrees, including especially through the use of AI and machine learning technologies to track people’s every movement at all times.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> @AchmatX’s reference to a class field trip where students “walked around Harlem to observe homelessness, substance use, [and] poverty” could not be confirmed by Spectator. The syllabus, however, does list an activity for Sept. 15 in which students walked through Morningside Park and along 125th Street to visit the 125th Street BID storefront hub. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> New York City Council District Nine council member Kristin Richardson Jordan replied to @AchmatX’s thread, writing that attempting to “redesign” Harlem without the input of Black Harlem residents is “atrocious and UNACCEPTABLE.” She did not return requests for comment at the time of publication. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “We know our students benefit from direct engagement with both organizations and individual residents,” Yarhi-Milo wrote in her email. “We strongly believe that the Harlem community benefits, in turn from our faculty and student contributions.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The UFAD questioned the “empty platitudes” about the course’s community-centered approach and who “Co-Designing Smart Cities” as a class truly serves. The organization demanded the University cancel the course, issue an apology to the Harlem community, and encouraged enrolled students to drop the class. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “One would have to be incredibly naive to honestly claim that Columbia’s efforts to transform the neighborhood of Harlem into a ‘smart city’ is anything but maleficent,” the UFAD wrote. “Sadly, those who make such claims are not generally naive, but deeply cynical and committed to furthering Columbia’s fundamental agenda of expanding corporate power.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Yarhi-Milo wrote that SIPA has met with the students and faculty involved in the course to offer them support and “explore ways we can learn from this experience.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “We know there are numerous viewpoints in every community,” Yarhi-Milo wrote. “Being adaptive and responsive to community needs is an important part of public policy. Students in the course experience this in real-time, and we look forward to continued and effective engagement with current partners and future collaborators.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Deputy News Editor Isabella Ramírez can be contacted at </i><a href="mailto:isabella.ramirez@columbiaspectator.com"><i>Isabella.Ramirez@columbiaspectator.com</i></a><i>.
